                <h3>About the Project</h3>

                <p>A-Line Studio was retained to redesign and renovate the first floor of this 33-story full-service co-op building with a 24-hour doorman. We upgraded the concierge station, added a package storage, reconfigured the mailroom, enlarged the on-site administrative offices, added a gym, upgraded the community room finishes, and redesigned the community space kitchen.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>

                <p>Working with a previously approved design scheme for the lobby and community room spaces, I was tasked with producing a complete set of as-built drawings, construction drawings and specifications. I specified smaller FF&E items and was the lead project manager during construction. Scope of work enlarged during construction and I contributed to the design of the administrative offices, public restrooms, kitchen and gym. I also managed the invoicing, purchasing, delivery and installation of all decorative furnishings and lighting.</p>

                <p>The original design was tailored to repairing and refurbishing the original terrazzo flooring throughout both front and back lobbies and the mailroom. During construction, we came to the decision that it would result in better value and aesthetic appeal if the flooring be replaced at this time. It was something that our client was considering replacing in the future, but I suggested that they undertake this work now, which they aggreed with. This meant that I needed to efficiently design a complementary flooring pattern and select a material that was stocked in large quantities (over 2500 sq ft) as well as fit in with the level of materials and scheme that were already more than half-built.</p>

             <div class="col-12 col-md-6">

              <p>I found a range of material options and the building’s Board ultimately chose a high-quality, in-stock marble tile from Porcelanosa. The contractor worked with us on the labor costs, opting to install the tiles directly over the terrazzo (ripping it out would have added significant time to the project as well as was essentially cost prohibitive). The co-op board moved quickly to approve the budget and new design. The result was not only beautiful but the building’s board was able to see the transformative power of this large design element, plus the value that it added to their property. They were very happy with the result.</p>
